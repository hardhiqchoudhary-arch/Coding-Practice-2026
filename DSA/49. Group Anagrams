class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        res = defaultdict(list)
        for s in strs:
            count = [0] * 26
            for c in s:
                count[ord(c)-ord("a")] += 1
                
            res[tuple(count)].append(s)
        return list(res.values())


Here, first we are creating a counting frequency list from 0 to 26 for each alphabets. 
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0...]

then, for each character in one particular string, we are subtracting ascii value of that keyword with ascii value of 'a'
For each character we increase its position:

For 't' → ord('t') - ord('a') = 19
count[19] += 1

For 'e' → ord('e') - ord('a') = 4
count[4] += 1

For 'a' → ord('a') - ord('a') = 0
count[0] += 1

Final count list becomes:

[1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
this list can appear for many strings , means they have same letters.


-----


"res[tuple(count)].append(s)"

We append the string s into the list belonging to that key.

Example:

If s = "eat":

res[(count_tuple)] becomes ["eat"]


If later s = "tea" arrives, it has the SAME tuple key, so:

res[(count_tuple)].append("tea")


Now dictionary looks like:

res = {
   (1,0,0,0,1,...,1): ["eat", "tea"]
}
